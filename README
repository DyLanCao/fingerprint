* what is it?
= "fingerprint" module generates fingerprints of a document.

* Okay i now know about it a bit, tell me how it calculates fingerprints?
= Generation of fingerprints of a document is a three stage process;
[1st phase]: generates the k-grams from the standard string
[2nd phase]: generates the hash values for each k-gram using rolling hash function 
[3rd phase]: generates the fingerprints from the hash values using winnowing

* Hmm! ... How can i use it?
= It's plain simple. Here's an example for you;
  
    from fingerprint import file_content_refiner, FingerprintGenerator
  
    # You could get the standard string from a document as;
    s = file_content_refiner("path/to/file")
    # OR you could directly pass the standard string if you have
    s = "some sample string"
    
    fpg = FingerprintGenerator(input_string=s)
    fpg.generate_fingerprints()
    print fpg.fingerprints
